Recover the application.host config file from the C:\inetput\history to replace the corrupt file and restart IIS


To access the history of the applicationHost.config file.

1.  Browse to C:\inetpub\history directory
2.  Inside this directory you will find the history of all the applicationHost.config file.
3.  Pick a applicationHost.config file that you know is not corrupted.  I usually pick one a few hours back to be safe.
4.  Copy the applicationHost.config file and paste it into the C:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\config directory, replacing the corrupted file.
5.  Now attempt to access IIS7 again.  This time IIS7 should open, and you should be able to access all your sites and web apps.
